# Being Well with enterprise Value
### by using film `Asha`, coach `aiSaki`, and other asset offerings


You and society are invited to the next level of Well Being and enterprise Value by also using offerings such as film `Asha` and coach `aiSaki`.

* Film `Asha: the Light of Hope` is a short film for newborn longevity (and as a background context for leadership anywhere). Its video link for public viewing will be here by 2018-Aug.

* To Declare a Breakdown in any area of life and create a future that matters, you can use (intelligent-machine) coach `aiSaki` by [clicking here](https://vinitk.shinyapps.io/aiSaki/) from a browser on your mobile device or computer. Following voice persona will soon be integrated with this app:
``` {r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # beware: turned off messages such as Warning: package 'shiny' was built under R version 3.4.4
  # in RStudio, create new repository project from Github. Then 'Knit to HTML' after turning on
  # Advanced setting 'Keep Markdown files' on the .Rmd. Then change YAML to the following:
  #   html_document:
  #     keep_md: yes
  # instead of the following:
  # output: 
  #   github_document
  # ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content
  # ref: http://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html

  # add a voice persona to introduce coach *aiSaki* using the following:
  library(shiny)
  tags$audio(src = "persona-JagjitSingh.mp3", type = "audio/mp3", autoplay = NA, controls = NA)

  # ![](URL) syntax can be used for linking to film Asha video outside this code chunk. alt:
  # tags$video(src = "rabbit320.mp4", type = "video/mp4", autoplay = NA, controls = NA)
    # height, width can be set too as parameters
  # <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE"
  #   target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
  #   alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
  # Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
  # [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)]
  #   (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)

```
