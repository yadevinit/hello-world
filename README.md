In 2012-Feb, the [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) committed to a wealth ecosystem that harmonized alignment of fund-management fees with extraordinary growth and [Net Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value). By 2015, this [report](http://pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=682) happened for a national pension-fund regulator. Back in 2012-Feb, the author committed to raised Well Being of a million people. And by 2015, [India Newborn Action Plan](http://nhm.gov.in/india-newborn-action-plan.html) was "Indiaâ€™s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP)." The author was *one* cause in the matter, with no authority, given mandate, or precedent; such is a power available to all human beings. The author wishes that everyone be aware of and exercise this power.

You and society are invited to the next level of Well Being and enterprise Value by also using offerings such as film `Asha` and coach `aiSaki`.

* Film `Asha: the Light of Hope` is a short film inviting you and society to the next level of newborn longevity. It sets a background for generating leadership anywhere. Use it, share it, and participate in co-creating a new realm of society Being Well by [clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ldaTXYRks).

* To Declare a Breakdown in any area of life and create a future that matters, you can use (intelligent-machine) coach `aiSaki` by [clicking here](https://yadevinit.shinyapps.io/aiSaki/) from a browser on your mobile device or computer. Regarding what's next with `aiSaki` on the technology front:

    + Its software can publicly evolve at its [source-code repository](https://github.com/yadevinit/aiSaki) with this [license](./LICENSE).

    + Presently, this app is hosted using the secure [shinyapps.io by RStudio](http://www.shinyapps.io/). A [JupyterLab Notebook architecture](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html) is being considered to support its future evolution, including unrestricted use of Python (and other language) modules from GitHub. Making it into an [R](http://r-project.org/) package and consistent with [OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/) are expected to ease and attract community interfaces and participation.
